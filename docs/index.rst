Flask API & React/Redux SPA
===========================

A **production-ready** boilerplate built with **Python 3**, **Flask** and **ES6 React**.

On the backend, it comes pre-configured with **SQLAlchemy** for data persistence, and includes a polished integration between **Flask-RESTful** and **Flask-Marshmallow** for painless model loading and serialization. **User authentication and registration** come working out-of-the-box, thanks to a little help from **Flask-Security**.

For the frontend, we use **React v16** built by **Webpack 3 and Babel** with **Hot Reloading**. **Redux** and the awesome **Redux-Saga** library handle side-effects. And to tie it all together, **React Router** provides component-based routing.
